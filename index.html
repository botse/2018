                    <p class="lead">Bots (short for software robots) are software applications that perform often repetitive or simple tasks. In particular, social and chat bots interacting with humans are a recent research topic. Similarly, bots can be used to automate many tasks that are performed by software practitioners and teams in their day-to-day work. Recent work argue that bots can save developers' time and significantly increase productivity. Therefore, the goal of this one-day workshop is to bring together software engineering researchers and practitioners to discuss the opportunities and challenges of bots in software engineering.

We solicit <strong> 4 page, research, experience report and position papers.</strong> Research papers are expected to describe new research results and make contributions to the body knowledge in the area. Experience reports are expected to describe experiences with (amongst other things) the development, deployment, and maintenance of bot-based systems in the software engineering domain. Position papers are expected to discuss controversial issues in the field, or describe interesting or thought provoking ideas that are not yet fully developed. Papers will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Accepted research and experience report papers will be invited to give a talk to present their findings. Authors of accepted position papers will be invited to give a short lightning talk. 
Papers may address issues along the general themes, including but not limited, to the following topics:

                    <ul>
                    <li> Using bots to derive software requirements and documentation </li>
                    <li> Using bots in the context of the reliability and quality of software systems</li>
                    <li> Using bots to support software system release and deployment</li>
                    <li> Using bots to enhance and support testing & maintenance of software systems</li>
                    <li> Supporting and answering developer questions using bots</li>
                    <li> Using bots to ensure the safety, security, privacy and trustworthiness of software systems</li>
                    <li> Effective processes for the development of bot-based software</li>
                    <li> Privacy and ethics issues related to the use of bots in software systems</li>
                    <li> Issues in the interaction of bots and developers and other stakeholders</li>

						<b>Simon Oberthür: App stores - Past, present and future development and their role our fast changing world </b>
                        </p>				
						<p class="lead">
						App Stores and the Internet changed, how software is delivered and perceived.
This talk looks at key features of app market stores and what impact they had and have on software delivery. Modern key features are: continuous delivery, user ratings and comments, equal access for developer and analytic tools. It ends with a peak into the future: Modern infrastructures like cloud computing and the upcoming 5G network are giving a new bases for app stores beside the ‘classical’ app store areas: mobile and desktop.

						<b>Alessandra Gorla: Mining the Google Play for Anomalies</b>
						</p>				
						<p class="lead">
                        In this talk I will present several analysis techniques that we have developed in the last few years in order to identify anomalous Android applications on the Google Play. We can detect anomalies that involve mismatches between the description and the implementation, anomalies in the use of sensitive information, and anomalies in the user interface. I will conclude the talk by also presenting the most recent work on detecting anomalies on how applications evolve across different releases.

						About the speaker: Alessandra Gorla is an Assistant Research Professor at the IMDEA Software Institute since December 2014. She received her Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in computer science from the University of Milano-Bicocca in Italy, and she completed her Ph.D. in informatics at the Università della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland in 2011. In her Ph.D. thesis she defined and developed the notion of Automatic Workarounds, a self-healing technique to recover Web applications from field failures, a work for which she received the Fritz Kutter Award for the best industry related Ph.D. thesis in computer science in Switzerland. Before joining the IMDEA Software Institute, she has been a postdoctoral researcher in the software engineering group at Saarland University in Germany. During her postdoc, she has also been a visiting researcher at Google in Mountain View. Her primary research activities are in the areas of software engineering, with a particular focus on the automation of software testing and analysis activities, and mobile application security.
